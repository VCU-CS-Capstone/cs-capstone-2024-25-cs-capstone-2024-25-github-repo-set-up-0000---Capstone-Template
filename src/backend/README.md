## Setting Up The Development Environment

### Setup Rust

Follow the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

#### On Windows
You might need to also install the C++ Build Tools.
You can use [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) to handle that for you.
